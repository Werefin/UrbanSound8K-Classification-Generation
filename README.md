# UrbanSound8K-Classification-Generation

## About this project



### 1. Audio classification on UrbanSound8K dataset

CNN model that can classify 10 different sounds with a fairly high accuracy. The key is to use Mel-Frequency Cesptral Coefficients (MFCCs) to turn the audio points into a spatial representation.

### 2. Audio generation using CVAE


### Dependencies and Setup
